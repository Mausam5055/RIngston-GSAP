## 🌟 Features

1. **💍 Scroll-Linked 3D Ring Animation:** As you scroll, a 3D ring object emerges from its box, scales dynamically, and moves out of the viewport, creating a captivating central animation tied directly to scroll progress. 
2. **💫 Parallax Effects:** Various UI elements move at different speeds during scrolling, adding depth and a subtle sense of movement to the layout. 
3. **↔️ Pinned Horizontal Scroll Section:** This section pins to the viewport and transitions to horizontal scrolling. Within this section, each distinct part features scroll-linked, staggered animations for text elements. 
4. **🧊 3D Object Re-Entry (Wireframe):** Further down the page, the 3D ring object reappears, potentially showcasing a cool wireframe aesthetic, providing a visual callback.
5. **AI-generated 3D box model:** Using text to image, then image to 3D model, and then positioning it under appropriate lighting for look and feel.
